A Rust library for end-to-end encryption key management using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of encrypted keys.
Purpose

Inari facilitates creating end-to-end encrypted services like Ente and Filen by simplifying secure, hierarchical key wrapping systems. It handles key derivation trees, root validation, and encrypted key storage complexity.

## Target Features

- Efficient DAG-based key hierarchy management
- Production-safe mutation APIs with robust error handling
- Seamless persistence integration
- Crypto-primitive agnostic design

## Development Status

This is a personal project for me to learn Rust, as well as give something back to open source community. While there is no plan to make it production ready for now, the goal is to learn enough of Rust to get there.
